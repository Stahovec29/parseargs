# To use the skeleton
# Make a copy of the skeleton directory, name it after the new project
# Rename (move) the NAME directory to be the name of the new project, or what the root module should be called
# Edit the setup.py to have all of the information for the project
# Rename (move) tests/NAME_tests.py to have new module name
# See that it's working by running nosetests again
